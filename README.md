# TIP-ISO9613
Summaries of some tips for ISO9613-2 and recommendations for number of reflections when implementing it.
This project tries to find out which relfection number should we use when we implement the ISO algorithm in noise mapping.

## Main file/function
The main file is **main_cmp_refl.py**, which include two separate main functions. 
 * The first function is **cmp_refl_iso_pierce_rigid_A()** used to plot the results of a section between the source and the receiver. 
 * The other main function is **cmp_refl_iso_pierce_rigid_A2()** used to plot the total contribution of a 200 m line of point sources.

## Sub-functions
  * **iso9613_2.py**: implementation of the ISO9613-2 algorithm for the diffraction part
  * **line_x_poly.py**: return the intersection of a line an a polygon
  * **pierce_diffr_rigid.py**: implementation of the Pierce's diffraction method with rigid surface
  * **pierce_diffr.py.py**: implementation of the Pierce's diffraction method with impedance surface. This function is not applied in this project.
