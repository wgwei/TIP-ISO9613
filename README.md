# TIP-ISO9613
Summaries of some tips for ISO9613-2 and recommendations for number of reflections when implementing it.

Some commercial softare, such as CadanaA, implements the ISO9613-2 propagation model to their modules. 
It usaully offers the reflectioin number to include reflectioins both in horizontal plane and vertical plane.
When calculating the diffraction attenuation in the vertical plane, the ISO suggests a 20 dB and 25 dB limit 
for thin and thick barriers.
